# welcome to my Repository outlook

 ## <ins>lets begin</ins>

As a beginner i'm using this space to learn and get to know more about software development and explore different tools ,programming languages and development concepts. i am curently focusing on (Html,css and javascrip) and using github . This repository will grow as i continue to build new projects and improve existing ones.

## Why javascript and Css

**This is because it is much easier to understand and its beginner friendly i find it much better to use compared to the other languages**
